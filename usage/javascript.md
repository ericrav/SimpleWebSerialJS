# JavaScript Usage

## Basics

{% hint style="info" %}
Basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript is assumed.
{% endhint %}

To use the library, store an instance of it in a variable by calling its connect method:

```javascript
const connection = SimpleSerial.connect();
```

### Listening to events

Define events you want to listen to with the `on` method. `on`takes an event name as its first parameter and a callback as its second:

```javascript
connection.on('event-from-arduino', function(data) {
    console.log('Received event "event-from-arduino" with parameter ' + data)
});
```

### Sending events

You can also send events to the Arduino, any valid JSON can be sent as parameter. This includes numbers, strings, arrays and objects:

```javascript
connection.send('event-with-string', "Hello there, Arduino");

connection.send('event-with-number', 123);

connection.send('event-with-array', [42, "Nice string"];

connection.send('event-with-object', { r: 255, g: 255, b: 255 });
```

That's the basics! There are a few more concepts, like waiting for the serial write to finish, customising the set-up routine and removing listeners, but this is enough to build your first applications.

## Methods

### connect\(null \| number baudRate \| object constructorObject\)

When creating a SimpleSerial instance, it has a default set-up that works out of the box. However, you can adjust this to your needs.

**Example:**

```javascript
const conn  = SimpleSerial.connect(); // Default, out-of-the-box behavior
const conn2 = SimpleSerial.connect(9600); // Connect with a lower connection speed
const conn3 = SimpleSerial.connect({ // Connection with a custom constructor object
    baudRate: 9600,
    requestAccessOnPageLoad: false,
});
```

**constructorObject**

The constructor object can be used to customize the behavior of the connection, i.e. whether the library should ask for permission to use the serial port on page load, or if incoming serial data should be logged. A list of possible properties can be found below.

**baudRate: number** _\(Default: 57600\)_  
The baud rate \(think: connection speed\) used for the library. If you change this, make sure to also change it in your Arduino code! If you set it too high, the internal Arduino buffer might overflow.

**requestAccessOnPageLoad: bool** _\(Default: true\)_  
Defines whether the library should display a modal on page load, asking for permission to use the Web Serial API. If you want to handle authorization yourself, or at a later point in your app, set this to false.

**requestButton: string \| HTMLElement** _\(Default: null\)_  
Defines an element to use for authorization. Can be an id, e.g. "authorization-button", or an HTMLElement. An event listener will be attached to the element, and when the user clicks the element, the "Chose the serial port you want to use" dialogue will appear. Should only be used when requestAccessOnPageLoad is set to false.

**accessText: string** _\(Default: "To access serial devices, user interaction is required. Please press this button to select the port you want to connect to."\)_  
Let's you customise the message that appears in the modal on page load when requestAccessOnPageLoad is set to true \(default\).

**accessButtonLabel: string** _\(Default: "Connect to Serial Port."\)_  
Let's you customise the label of the button that appears in the modal on page load when requestAccessOnPageLoad is set to true \(default\).

**styleDomElements: bool** _\(Default: true\)_  
Whether the library should apply basic styling to the modal so it does in fact look like a modal. If you want to style the modal yourself, set this to false.

**transformer: TransformStream** _\(Default: new LineBreakTransformer\(\)\)_  
What kind of transformer should be used to transform incoming serial data. Per default this is a integrated linebreak transformer, which adds serial data into a buffer until a linebreak character occurs, at which point the buffer gets sent to the library for event handling. If you want to write your own transformer, check out the [TransformStream interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TransformStream).

**logIncomingSerialData: bool** _\(Default: false\)_  
If set to true, will use console.log\(\) to log all incoming serial data from the Arduino. Use for debugging.

**logOutgoingSerialData: bool** _\(Default: false\)_  
If set to true, will use console.log\(\) to log all outgoing serial data from the browser. Use for debugging.

**parseStringsAsNumber: bool** _\(Default: true\)_  
If set to true, will try to parse strings as numbers to avoid type errors. Example: Values from inputs like sliders or text inputs are strings. This setting will convert them into numbers so they can be used by the Arduino as such.

**filters: array** _\(Default: \[\]\)_  
The filters property allows you to filter available serial devices that are shown when requesting access to them. This can be used to write web applications for specific devices and prevent the user from connecting them to another device, preventing confusion.

## Instance Methods

These are methods that can be invoked on an instance of the library that has been initialized by calling SimpleSerial.connect\(\).

### .on\(string eventName, function callback\)

Define an event to listen to, and the callback to execute when the event gets sent by the Arduino. The callback accepts one parameter \(optional\), which can be any valid json \(numbers, strings, arrays, objects\).  Multiple listeners for a single event name are supported. Example:

```javascript
conn.on("log", function() {
    console.log("I received a log event!");
}

conn.on("log", function(data) {
    console.log(data);
})
```

#### .on\("data", function callback\)

When sending pure data from an Arduino via .sendData, listen to it by listening to the "data" event. Example:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Arduino" %}
```c
WebSerial.sendData(12345);
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
conn.on("data", function(data) {
    console.log(data)
})
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### .send\(eventName, JSON parameter\);

Send an event to the Arduino. First parameter is the event name, second any valid json that is sent to the callback function of the event on the Arduino. Example:

```javascript
conn.send("led", true); // Send event "led" with payload true
conn.send("requestAverage", { pin: 0, measureDuration: 2000 });
```

### .sendEvent\(string eventName\);

If you just want to send an event without any payload, you can use this helper function. Example:

```javascript
conn.sendEvent("requestData"); // Send event "requestData" without any payload
```

### .sendData\(JSON data\);

If you want to send pure data, you can use this. This will omit the event name and can be listened to on the Arduino via .on\("data", callback\). Example:

```javascript
conn.sendData(12345);
```

### .removeListener\(\[string eventName, function callback\]\)

Removes a previously defined event listener. It will no longer listen to incoming data. Example:

```javascript
const conn = new SimpleWebSerial();

const listener = conn.on("eventname", function() { /* do something */ });

conn.removeListener(listener); // the event "eventname" is no longer listened to
```

### .removeListeners\(string eventName\);

Removes all listeners of a single event name. Example:

```javascript
const conn = new SimpleWebSerial();

const listener1 = conn.on("eventname", function() { /* do something */ });
const listener2 = conn.on("eventname", function(data) { /* do something else */ });

conn.removeListeners("eventname"); // the event "eventname" is no longer listened to
```

### .requestSerialAccessOnClick\(string elementID \| HTMLElement element\)

If you use a framework like Vue or similar, and you want to handle requesting access to the serial port yourself, you might run into the problem that the element you want to use for user interaction \(e.g. a button\) does not exist on page load or when the library gets initialized. To get around this problem, you can use this method to programmatically attach a click listener to an element, which will then handle the authorization request for you. Example:

```javascript
const element = document.createElement("button");

const conn = new SimpleWebSerial();
conn.requestSerialAccessOnClick(element);

document.body.append(element);

// The element now listens for clicks and will
// display the authorization modal on click
```

## Advanced

### Asynchronous function calls

Writing to the serial port is not synchronous, or _asynchronous_. This means, your code will continue running while trying to write data to the serial port in the background.

```javascript
function sendEvent()  {
    connection.send('someEvent', "arbitrary data");
    console.log("I might be called before the event has been written");
}
```

To prevent this, you can make use `async` /`await` . This will make the execution of your code stop until the event has been successfully written. Mark your function as `async` and tell it to `await` the completion of the event before continuing:

```javascript
async function sendEvent() {
    await connection.send('someEvent', "arbitrary data");
    console.log("I definitely won't be called until the event has been written");
}
```

That's it! For more information on async / await, why it's very handy, or what to use as an alternative, you can refer to [this tutorial](https://javascript.info/async-await).
