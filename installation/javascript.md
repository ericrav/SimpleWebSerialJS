# JavaScript

## Via &lt;script&gt; tag

This is the easiest method to get you started immediately. Just include the script tag inside the `<head>` of your document and you're good to go.

```
<script lang="text/javascript" src="absolute-path-to-cdn">
```

That's it! Either [set-up the Arduino Library](arduino.md) as well, or take a look [how to use the JavaScript library](../usage/javascript.md).

## Via npm

```javascript
npm install simplewebserial
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
